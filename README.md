### Hi 👋, i'm Aaron - a full stack developer.
I’m currently learning Python & React and improving my skills in JS and SQL.
I’m looking to collaborate on any project to develop my knowledge, so feel free to reach out 😁.
I have recently completed a web-dev course at Le Wagon learning Ruby (inc Rails), JS, HTML, CSS & SQL; previous to this I self-taught some JS and built some basic apps. This included the completion of several full-scale projects including an AirBnB clone, a Movie Watch-list app and p-Ka, an app that lets users see comprhensive nutritrional and allergen information and more.
